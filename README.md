# Coffee-Linear-Regression
Creating linear regression model using sklearn and statsmodel.api
this is my attempt to understand linear regression using statsmodel and sklearn 
the dataset is a quality of coffee measured based on the taste by qgrader 
the model give a good result as the adjusted R squared reaches 0.72 

if you want to run the program simply use jupyter notebook put all the files in the same directories and run :)
